    "#### CPython vs PyPy\n",
    "\n",
    "To work mostly in a traditional environment, CPython is an excellent fit. If you don’t have a strong alternative preference, start with the standard CPython reference implementation, which is most widely supported by third-party add-ons and extensions and offers the most up-to-date version.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython, by definition, supports all Python extensions; however, PyPy supports most extensions, and it can often be faster for long-running programs thanks to ```just-in-time compilation``` to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jython and IronPython\n",
    "Jython, supporting Python on top of a JVM, and IronPython, supporting Python on top of .NET, are open source projects that, while offering production-level quality for the Python versions they support, appear to be “stalled” at the time of this writing, since the latest versions they support are substantially behind CPython’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda and Miniconda\n",
    "One of the most successful Python distributions in recent years is Anaconda. This open source package comes with a vast number of preconfigured and tested extension modules in addition to the standard library. In many cases, you might find that it contains all the necessary dependencies for your work. If your dependencies aren’t supported, you can also install modules with pip. On Unix-based systems, it installs very simply in a sngle directory: to activate it, just add the Anaconda bin subdirectory at the front of your shell PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is based on a packaging technology called conda. A sister implementation, Miniconda, gives access to the same extensions but does not come with them preloaded; it instead downloads them as required, making it a better choice for creating tailored environments. conda does not use the standard virtual environments, but contains equivalent facilities to allow separation of the dependencies for multiple projects.\n",

In many cases, you might find that it contains all the necessary dependencies for your work. If your dependencies aren’t supported, you can also install modules with pip. On Unix-based systems, it installs very simply in a single directory: to activate it, just add the Anaconda bin subdirectory at the front of your shell PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transcrypt: Convert your Python to JavaScript\n",
    "Many attempts have been made to make Python into a browser-based language, but JavaScript’s hold has been tenacious. The Transcrypt system is a pip-installable Python package to convert Python code (currently, up to version 3.9) into browser-executable JavaScript. You have full access to the browser’s DOM, allowing your code to dynamically manipulate window content and use JavaScript libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings and bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "b'abc'\n",
    "bytes([97, 98, 99]) # Same as the previous line\n",
    "rb'\\ = solidus' # A raw bytes literal, containing a\n",
    "'\\'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a bytes object to a str, use the bytes.decode method. To convert a str object to a bytes object, use the str.encode method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists vs Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two is that lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content, while tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change their content once they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can add or remove elements from a list using methods like append() and remove(), but you cannot do the same with a tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets, while lists cannot. This is because tuples are hashable (since they are immutable), while lists are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ellipsis (...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ellipsis, written as three periods with no intervening spaces, ..., is a special object in Python used in numerical applications, or as an alternative to None when None is a valid entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the numpy library, it is used to indicate a placeholder for the rest of the array dimensions not specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tally = dict.fromkeys(['A', 'B', None, ...], 0)\n",
    "print(tally) # {'A': 0, 'B': 0, None: 0, Ellipsis: 0}\n",
    "\n",
    "tally[...] = 1\n",
    "print(tally) # {'A': 0, 'B': 0, None: 0, Ellipsis: 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### mutability & Reference vs Value Based Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "since integers are ```immutable``` assigning $c$ to $a$ and $b$, assigns the value of $c$ to them as a new value based assignment. It's as if we assigned the new vars to a value severalty. So changes to any of the vars won't impact others.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with ```mutable``` objects, the assignment becomes reference based.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Immutable Example\n",
    "c = 0\n",
    "a = b = c\n",
    "a = 1\n",
    "print(b) # 0\n",
    "a += 1\n",
    "print(a, b, c) # 2 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Immutable Example\n",
    "s1 = 'abc'\n",
    "s2 = s1\n",
    "s2 = 'd'\n",
    "print(s1,s2) # abc d\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutable Example\n",
    "s1 = [1,2,3]\n",
    "s2 = s1\n",
    "s2.append(4)\n",
    "print(s1,s2) # [1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### del\n",
    "\n",
    "In all other cases, the del statement specifies a request to an object to unbind one or more of its attributes or items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assuming $del C[2]$ succeeds, when C is a dictionary, this makes future references to C[2] invalid (raising KeyError) until and unless you assign to C[2] again; but when C is a list, del C[2] implies that every following item of C “shifts left by one”—so, if C is long enough, future references to C[2] are still valid, but denote a different item than they did before the del (generally, what you’d have used C[3] to refer to, before the del statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```count``` L.count(x): Returns the number of items of L that are equal to x.\n",
    "- ```index``` L.index(x): Returns the index of the first occurrence of an item in L that is equal to x, or raises an exception if L has no such item.\n",
    "- ```append``` L.append(x): Appends item x to the end of L ; like L[len(L):] = [x].\n",

    "- ```pop``` L.pop(i=-1): Returns the value of the item at index i and removes it from L; when you omit i, removes and returns the last item; raises an exception when L is empty or i is an invalid index in L.\n",

    "- ```isdisjoint``` s.isdisjoint(s1): Returns True if the intersection of s and s1 is the empty set (they have no items in common), and otherwise returns False\n",

    "- ```issuperset``` s.issuperset(s1): Returns True when all items of s1 are also in s, and otherwise returns False (like s1.issubset(s)); can be written as s >= s1 \n",
    "- ```symmetric``` difference: s.symmetric_difference(s1) Returns the set of all items that are in either s or s1, but not both; can be written s ^ s1\n",
    "- ```union``` s.union(s1): Returns the set of all items that are in s, s1, or both; can be written as s | s1\n",
    "- ```add``` s.add(x): Adds x as an item to s; no effect if x was already an item in s\n",
    "- ```clear``` s.clear(): Removes all items from s, leaving s empty\n",
    "- ```discard``` s.discard(x): Removes x as an item of s; no effect when x was not an item of s\n",
    "- ```pop``` s.pop(): Removes and returns an arbitrary item of s\n",
    "- ```remove``` s.remove(x): Removes x as an item of s; raises a KeyError exception when x was not an item of s\n",

    "\n",
    "A function’s signature may contain a single positional-only marker (/) as a dummy parameter. The parameters preceding the marker are known as positional-only parameters, and must be provided as positional arguments, not named arguments, when calling the function; using named arguments for these parameters raises a TypeError exception. The built-in int type, for example, has the following signature: int(x, /, base=10)"

    "As mentioned previously, an import statement normally expects to find its target somewhere on ```sys.path—a``` behavior known as an ```absolute import```. Alternatively, you can explicitly use a ```relative import```, meaning an import of an object from within the current package. Using relative imports can make it easier for you to refactor or restructure the subpackages within your package. Relative imports use module or package names beginning with one or more dots, and are only available within the from statement. from . import X looks for the module or object named X in the current package; from .X import y looks in module or subpackage X within the current package for the module or object named y. If your package has subpackages, their code can access higher-up objects in the package by using multiple dots at the start of the module or subpackage name you place between from and import. Each additional dot ascends the directory hierarchy one level."
