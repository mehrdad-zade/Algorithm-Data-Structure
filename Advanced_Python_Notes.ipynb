    "#### CPython vs PyPy\n",
    "\n",
    "To work mostly in a traditional environment, CPython is an excellent fit. If you don’t have a strong alternative preference, start with the standard CPython reference implementation, which is most widely supported by third-party add-ons and extensions and offers the most up-to-date version.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython, by definition, supports all Python extensions; however, PyPy supports most extensions, and it can often be faster for long-running programs thanks to ```just-in-time compilation``` to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jython and IronPython\n",
    "Jython, supporting Python on top of a JVM, and IronPython, supporting Python on top of .NET, are open source projects that, while offering production-level quality for the Python versions they support, appear to be “stalled” at the time of this writing, since the latest versions they support are substantially behind CPython’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda and Miniconda\n",
    "One of the most successful Python distributions in recent years is Anaconda. This open source package comes with a vast number of preconfigured and tested extension modules in addition to the standard library. In many cases, you might find that it contains all the necessary dependencies for your work. If your dependencies aren’t supported, you can also install modules with pip. On Unix-based systems, it installs very simply in a sngle directory: to activate it, just add the Anaconda bin subdirectory at the front of your shell PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is based on a packaging technology called conda. A sister implementation, Miniconda, gives access to the same extensions but does not come with them preloaded; it instead downloads them as required, making it a better choice for creating tailored environments. conda does not use the standard virtual environments, but contains equivalent facilities to allow separation of the dependencies for multiple projects.\n",

    "#### Transcrypt: Convert your Python to JavaScript\n",
    "Many attempts have been made to make Python into a browser-based language, but JavaScript’s hold has been tenacious. The Transcrypt system is a pip-installable Python package to convert Python code (currently, up to version 3.9) into browser-executable JavaScript. You have full access to the browser’s DOM, allowing your code to dynamically manipulate window content and use JavaScript libraries.\n",
