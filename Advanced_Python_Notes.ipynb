    "#### CPython vs PyPy\n",
    "\n",
    "To work mostly in a traditional environment, CPython is an excellent fit. If you don’t have a strong alternative preference, start with the standard CPython reference implementation, which is most widely supported by third-party add-ons and extensions and offers the most up-to-date version.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython, by definition, supports all Python extensions; however, PyPy supports most extensions, and it can often be faster for long-running programs thanks to ```just-in-time compilation``` to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jython and IronPython\n",
    "Jython, supporting Python on top of a JVM, and IronPython, supporting Python on top of .NET, are open source projects that, while offering production-level quality for the Python versions they support, appear to be “stalled” at the time of this writing, since the latest versions they support are substantially behind CPython’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda and Miniconda\n",
    "One of the most successful Python distributions in recent years is Anaconda. This open source package comes with a vast number of preconfigured and tested extension modules in addition to the standard library. In many cases, you might find that it contains all the necessary dependencies for your work. If your dependencies aren’t supported, you can also install modules with pip. On Unix-based systems, it installs very simply in a sngle directory: to activate it, just add the Anaconda bin subdirectory at the front of your shell PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is based on a packaging technology called conda. A sister implementation, Miniconda, gives access to the same extensions but does not come with them preloaded; it instead downloads them as required, making it a better choice for creating tailored environments. conda does not use the standard virtual environments, but contains equivalent facilities to allow separation of the dependencies for multiple projects.\n",

On Unix-based systems, it installs very simply in a single directory: to activate it, just add the Anaconda bin subdirectory at the front of your shell PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transcrypt: Convert your Python to JavaScript\n",
    "Many attempts have been made to make Python into a browser-based language, but JavaScript’s hold has been tenacious. The Transcrypt system is a pip-installable Python package to convert Python code (currently, up to version 3.9) into browser-executable JavaScript. You have full access to the browser’s DOM, allowing your code to dynamically manipulate window content and use JavaScript libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings and bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "b'abc'\n",
    "bytes([97, 98, 99]) # Same as the previous line\n",
    "rb'\\ = solidus' # A raw bytes literal, containing a\n",
    "'\\'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a bytes object to a str, use the bytes.decode method. To convert a str object to a bytes object, use the str.encode method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists vs Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two is that lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content, while tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change their content once they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can add or remove elements from a list using methods like append() and remove(), but you cannot do the same with a tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets, while lists cannot. This is because tuples are hashable (since they are immutable), while lists are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ellipsis (...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ellipsis, written as three periods with no intervening spaces, ..., is a special object in Python used in numerical applications, or as an alternative to None when None is a valid entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the numpy library, it is used to indicate a placeholder for the rest of the array dimensions not specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tally = dict.fromkeys(['A', 'B', None, ...], 0)\n",
    "print(tally) # {'A': 0, 'B': 0, None: 0, Ellipsis: 0}\n",
    "\n",
    "tally[...] = 1\n",
    "print(tally) # {'A': 0, 'B': 0, None: 0, Ellipsis: 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### mutability & Reference vs Value Based Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "since integers are ```immutable``` assigning $c$ to $a$ and $b$, assigns the value of $c$ to them as a new value based assignment. It's as if we assigned the new vars to a value severalty. So changes to any of the vars won't impact others.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with ```mutable``` objects, the assignment becomes reference based.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Immutable Example\n",
    "c = 0\n",
    "a = b = c\n",
    "a = 1\n",
    "print(b) # 0\n",
    "a += 1\n",
    "print(a, b, c) # 2 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Immutable Example\n",
    "s1 = 'abc'\n",
    "s2 = s1\n",
    "s2 = 'd'\n",
    "print(s1,s2) # abc d\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutable Example\n",
    "s1 = [1,2,3]\n",
    "s2 = s1\n",
    "s2.append(4)\n",
    "print(s1,s2) # [1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### del\n",
    "\n",
    "In all other cases, the del statement specifies a request to an object to unbind one or more of its attributes or items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assuming $del C[2]$ succeeds, when C is a dictionary, this makes future references to C[2] invalid (raising KeyError) until and unless you assign to C[2] again; but when C is a list, del C[2] implies that every following item of C “shifts left by one”—so, if C is long enough, future references to C[2] are still valid, but denote a different item than they did before the del (generally, what you’d have used C[3] to refer to, before the del statement).\n",
    "\n",
