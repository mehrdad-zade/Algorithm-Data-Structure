    "#### CPython vs PyPy\n",
    "\n",
    "To work mostly in a traditional environment, CPython is an excellent fit. If you don’t have a strong alternative preference, start with the standard CPython reference implementation, which is most widely supported by third-party add-ons and extensions and offers the most up-to-date version.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython, by definition, supports all Python extensions; however, PyPy supports most extensions, and it can often be faster for long-running programs thanks to ```just-in-time compilation``` to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jython and IronPython\n",
    "Jython, supporting Python on top of a JVM, and IronPython, supporting Python on top of .NET, are open source projects that, while offering production-level quality for the Python versions they support, appear to be “stalled” at the time of this writing, since the latest versions they support are substantially behind CPython’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda and Miniconda\n",
    "One of the most successful Python distributions in recent years is Anaconda. This open source package comes with a vast number of preconfigured and tested extension modules in addition to the standard library. In many cases, you might find that it contains all the necessary dependencies for your work. If your dependencies aren’t supported, you can also install modules with pip. On Unix-based systems, it installs very simply in a sngle directory: to activate it, just add the Anaconda bin subdirectory at the front of your shell PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is based on a packaging technology called conda. A sister implementation, Miniconda, gives access to the same extensions but does not come with them preloaded; it instead downloads them as required, making it a better choice for creating tailored environments. conda does not use the standard virtual environments, but contains equivalent facilities to allow separation of the dependencies for multiple projects.\n",

    "#### Transcrypt: Convert your Python to JavaScript\n",
    "Many attempts have been made to make Python into a browser-based language, but JavaScript’s hold has been tenacious. The Transcrypt system is a pip-installable Python package to convert Python code (currently, up to version 3.9) into browser-executable JavaScript. You have full access to the browser’s DOM, allowing your code to dynamically manipulate window content and use JavaScript libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings and bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "b'abc'\n",
    "bytes([97, 98, 99]) # Same as the previous line\n",
    "rb'\\ = solidus' # A raw bytes literal, containing a\n",
    "'\\'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a bytes object to a str, use the bytes.decode method. To convert a str object to a bytes object, use the str.encode method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists vs Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two is that lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content, while tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change their content once they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can add or remove elements from a list using methods like append() and remove(), but you cannot do the same with a tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets, while lists cannot. This is because tuples are hashable (since they are immutable), while lists are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ellipsis (...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ellipsis, written as three periods with no intervening spaces, ..., is a special object in Python used in numerical applications, or as an alternative to None when None is a valid entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the numpy library, it is used to indicate a placeholder for the rest of the array dimensions not specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tally = dict.fromkeys(['A', 'B', None, ...], 0)\n",
    "print(tally) # {'A': 0, 'B': 0, None: 0, Ellipsis: 0}\n",
    "\n",
    "tally[...] = 1\n",
    "print(tally) # {'A': 0, 'B': 0, None: 0, Ellipsis: 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### mutability & Reference vs Value Based Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "since integers are ```immutable``` assigning $c$ to $a$ and $b$, assigns the value of $c$ to them as a new value based assignment. It's as if we assigned the new vars to a value severalty. So changes to any of the vars won't impact others.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with ```mutable``` objects, the assignment becomes reference based.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Immutable Example\n",
    "c = 0\n",
    "a = b = c\n",
    "a = 1\n",
    "print(b) # 0\n",
    "a += 1\n",
    "print(a, b, c) # 2 0 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Immutable Example\n",
    "s1 = 'abc'\n",
    "s2 = s1\n",
    "s2 = 'd'\n",
    "print(s1,s2) # abc d\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutable Example\n",
    "s1 = [1,2,3]\n",
    "s2 = s1\n",
    "s2.append(4)\n",
    "print(s1,s2) # [1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### del\n",
    "\n",
    "In all other cases, the del statement specifies a request to an object to unbind one or more of its attributes or items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assuming $del C[2]$ succeeds, when C is a dictionary, this makes future references to C[2] invalid (raising KeyError) until and unless you assign to C[2] again; but when C is a list, del C[2] implies that every following item of C “shifts left by one”—so, if C is long enough, future references to C[2] are still valid, but denote a different item than they did before the del (generally, what you’d have used C[3] to refer to, before the del statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```count``` L.count(x): Returns the number of items of L that are equal to x.\n",
    "- ```index``` L.index(x): Returns the index of the first occurrence of an item in L that is equal to x, or raises an exception if L has no such item.\n",
    "- ```append``` L.append(x): Appends item x to the end of L ; like L[len(L):] = [x].\n",
    "- ```clear``` L.clear(): Removes all items from L, leaving L empty.\n",
    "- ```extend``` L.extend(s): Appends all the items of iterable s to the end of L; like L[len(L):] = s or L += s.\n",
    "- ```insert``` L.insert(i, x): Inserts item x in L before the item at index i, moving following items of L (if any) “rightward” to make space (increases len(L) by one, does not replace any item, does not raise exceptions; acts just like L[i:i]=[x]).\n",
    "- ```pop``` L.pop(i=-1): Returns the value of the item at index i and removes it from L; when you omit i, removes and returns the last item; raises an exception when L is empty or i is an invalid index in L.\n",
    "- ```remove``` L.remove(x): Removes from L the first occurrence of an item in L that is equal to x, or raises an exception when L has no such item.\n",
    "- ```reverse``` L.reverse(): Reverses, in place, the items of L.\n",
    "- ```sort``` L.sort(key=None, reverse=False): Sorts, in place, the items of L (in ascending order, by default; in descending order, if the argument reverse is True). When the argument key is not None, what gets compared for each item x is key(x), not x itself. For more details, see the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```copy``` s.copy(): Returns a shallow copy of s (a copy whose items are the same objects as s’s, not copies thereof); like set(s)\n",
    "- ```difference``` s.difference(s1): Returns the set of all items of s that aren’t in s1; can be written as s - s1 intersection s.intersection(s1) Returns the set of all items of s that are also in s1; can be written as s & s1\n",
    "- ```isdisjoint``` s.isdisjoint(s1): Returns True if the intersection of s and s1 is the empty set (they have no items in common), and otherwise returns False\n",
    "- ```issubset``` s.issubset(s1): Returns True when all items of s are also in s1, and otherwise returns False; can be written as s <= s1\n",
    "- ```issuperset``` s.issuperset(s1): Returns True when all items of s1 are also in s, and otherwise returns False (like s1.issubset(s)); can be written as s >= s1 \n",
    "- ```symmetric``` difference: s.symmetric_difference(s1) Returns the set of all items that are in either s or s1, but not both; can be written s ^ s1\n",
    "- ```union``` s.union(s1): Returns the set of all items that are in s, s1, or both; can be written as s | s1\n",
    "- ```add``` s.add(x): Adds x as an item to s; no effect if x was already an item in s\n",

    "- ```pop``` s.pop(): Removes and returns an arbitrary item of s\n",
    "- ```remove``` s.remove(x): Removes x as an item of s; raises a KeyError exception when x was not an item of s\n",

    "#### '/' in Function Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "A function’s signature may contain a single positional-only marker (/) as a dummy parameter. The parameters preceding the marker are known as positional-only parameters, and must be provided as positional arguments, not named arguments, when calling the function; using named arguments for these parameters raises a TypeError exception. The built-in int type, for example, has the following signature: int(x, /, base=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### '*' in Function Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Asterisk (*): The asterisk in a function signature has multiple uses depending on its placement:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Variadic Positional Parameters: When the asterisk is placed before a parameter name, it allows the function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. These arguments are gathered into a tuple within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "```\n",
    "def example(*args):\n",
    "    for arg in args:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, args is a tuple that contains all the positional arguments passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Variadic Keyword Parameters: When the asterisk is placed before a parameter name in the function signature, it allows the function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments. These arguments are gathered into a dictionary within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def example(**kwargs):\n",
    "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, kwargs is a dictionary that contains all the keyword arguments passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Unpacking Arguments: When the asterisk is used during a function call, it can be used to unpack a list, tuple, or dictionary into individual arguments to be passed to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def example(a, b, c):\n",
    "    print(a, b, c)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When a named parameter’s default value is a mutable object, and the function body alters the parameter, things get tricky. For example:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second print prints [23, 42] because the first call to f altered the default value of y, originally an empty list [], by appending 23 to it. The id values (always equal to each other, although otherwise arbitrary) confirm that both calls return the same object. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use y in above example as a cache for handling expensive calculations and turn it around and between functions. This is called ```memoization```.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want y to be a new, empty list object, each time you call f with a single argument (a far more frequent need!), use the following idiom instead:\n",
